2. Motivation
  
 As I used to play shadowrun for a very long time, I started with an editor in Delphi for shadowrun 2.0, 
 many year later I started a technology study with emf for the 3.01 version, as my group has now moved
 to 5.0 and the chummer project don't work well on linux I have moved some of the model to 5.0. This is
 a kind of technology study, working with an model driven approach.
