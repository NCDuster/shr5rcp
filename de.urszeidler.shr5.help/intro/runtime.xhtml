<h3>gamemaster aid</h3>

<p>The script runtime is meant for the game master as a management of the game play. 
With the included webapp it is possible for the player to manage the characters by them self.

You can play the script with you favored player characters. A script stores the information of the 
current game session so you can return to your game session on another day, simply save the data 
at the end of the day. So you need a created characters of your players, they can export and you 
import them as it is always good having a copy of your chummer. </p>
<p>After setting the initiative the combat view displays the list of initatives, the current active phase is at the 
top where the active character can choose it's actions, the right and left and are displayed, a character might choose 
using the object, dropping or change it.</p>

<p>When using, the appropriated action is created, for a melee weapon a complex action and so on. 
This is the "step 1. declare", of resolving combat.</p>

<h3>player wab app</h3>
<p>Provides the runtime a game master aiding in several aspects of the gameplay, 
it was a gamemaster only thing, by adding a web server and app we add a way of 
collaboration to the application. Players can impersonate their characters and take 
part in the game flow by filling in their dice result, changing the inventory etc.. </p>
<p>You can start a webserver which provides a simple 
<a href="https://github.com/UrsZeidler/shr5rcp/wiki/script-webapp">web app</a> giving mobile clients access 
to impersonate a <a href="https://github.com/UrsZeidler/shr5rcp/wiki/script-webapp-player">single player character</a>. As we are shadowrunners and don't trust the 
cooperations this is done with the local area network, LAN. </p>
